# multiMamoth
A client that allow to be connected to few mastodon instances at the same time

Mastodon is a free open source Twitterlike social network. Everyone can setup a new mastodon instance.
When you sign in a mastodon instance, you are not signed in the others (obviusly). So, if you signed in 5 different instances, if you want to have a view of your full actuality flow, you have to open 5 different tabs with your 5 instances.

multiMamoth will allow you to have a single actuality flow for all your instances.
